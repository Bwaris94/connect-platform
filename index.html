          well for starters, web-service logic is essentially asynchronous,
          which results in non-linear execution flows, while we are representing such flows in an
          extremely linear fashion, that is, a sequence of characters.
        </div>
        <br/>
        <div class="small">
          So, we do this:

          <pre><code class="javascript">
doA().then(function(outA) {
  doB(outA).then(function(outB) {

  });

        <div class="small">

doA().then(function(outA) {
  Promise.all([

    new Promise(function(resolve) {

        <h1>is that it?</h1>
        <div class="small">
          of course not. i mean, it is not just about sync and async code. doing backend code
          is becoming more and more stale and repetitive and boring by the day, while it should
          essentially be focusing on the core business logic that you want to do with your service.
          <br><br>
          we believe the main reason is that software development is essentially two separate
          processes mashed into each other in an unholy manner:

          <h1><span class="hl">micrologic, i.e. creating building blocks</span></h1>
          this is what programming languages were created for. to create some building blocks,
          which are usually more independent from the business logic and hence highly reusable.
          and,

          <h1><span class="hl">macrologic, or building something with those building blocks</span></h1>
          which is the larger-scope logic of the product. think user journey, process analysis,
          or however context a product designer/manager/owner/whatever might like to describe
          the product. this is far less reusable as it is highly entangled in the product definition
          and goals itself.

          <br><br>

          <b>these two processes require different skill sets</b>, technically skilled people excell at doing
          the former while you require product-manager-ish people to correctly do the latter.
          <br><br>
          <b>they also require different mind-sets as well</b>, while creating some building blocks you are not
          thinking of user and product's flow, you are thinking performance, reusability, etc,
          yet while you are connecting them together to form a backend service as part of your product's
          business logic you are not thinking of performance or reusability, you are thinking of what
          happens to your users and where the data flows in your system.
          <br><br>
          <b>they even require different tools</b>, since the building blocks themselves are usually better
          off done in classic synchronous codes, while the high-level logic of a web service is
          definitely asynchronous in nature, and as discussed above, programming languages aren't
          the best tools to do the latter.
          <br><br>
          however, in the end of the day, we are now doing them all in one place through programming them.
          product people aren't as hands-on (as they cannot be with complex codes we have), so although
          they offer some idea of what is to be implemented, the work is on the shoulder of technical people
          still. in this light, it is rather obvious why separating these two with a tool like
          <span class="hl">CONNECT platform</span>
          and putting people with the correct skills and mindsets in charge of each greatly increases
          speed and productivity.
