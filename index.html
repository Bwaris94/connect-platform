          I hate it that building API micro-services isn't as easy as just a few clicks
          and drags, specifically when most of the time you don't need extremely convoluted
          logical or hefty computational code on them. the goal of this project is to change that.

    <section id="idea">
      <h1>what is the idea?</h1>
      <div class="small">
        the main idea is to build something like this:
      </div>
      <br/>
      <a class="img" href="assets/idea.svg" target="_blank">
        <img src="assets/idea.svg"/>
      </a>
      <br/><br/>
      <div class="small">
        which, to be more precise, is a nodejs package that enables you to
        use such a panel for development. you should be able to add "native" javascript
        code to it easily, and use them as boxes, which I like to call <span class="hl">nodes</span>,
        like above.
      </div>
      <br/>
      <a onclick="scrollToSection($('#intuition'))">hmmm ...</a>
    </section>
    <section id="intuition" class="full">
      <div>
        <h1>cool, but why?</h1>
        <div class="small">
          the intuition is to seperate <span class="hl">micro-logic</span> and <span class="hl">macro-logic</span>,
          i.e. logic that has a limited domain (like a password check, database query, etc)
          and logic whose scope encapsulates the whole service, as <span class="hl">micro-logic</span>
          is extremely repetetive and when done in the correct structure heavily reusable,
          and it is the <span class="hl">macro-logic</span> of each service that is unique
          and requires work.
        </div>
        <br/>
        <div class="small">
          however, without that seperation, the work that needs to be done gets cluttered
          up and I believe that is one of the main reasons that with all the available tools
          we have today it is still a cumbersome thing to do.
        </div>
        <br/>
        <div class="small">
          I think by seperating the two and encapsulating <span class="hl">micro-logic</span>
          into reusable chunks, the main task that remains, which is defining the
          <span class="hl">macro-logic</span>, will be an extremely easy one, easy enough
          to be able to be done via a visual panel as the one demonstrated above.
        </div>
        <br/>
        <div class="small">
          and since that is the main design intuition here, I hope that with the tools provided
          via this project even pure coding (of nodejs api micro-services) becomes far more
          streamlined and structured as well.

          I've just started this project, so if you want to get it a test
          run I am afraid you have to be a little patient. however, if you'd like,
          you can take a look at the codes or even run them and see whats going on,
          or directly contact me.
