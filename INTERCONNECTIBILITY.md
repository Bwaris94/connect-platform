# INTER-CONNECTIBILITY

a service is called (in the context of this document) **inter-connectible** if it provides its public API 
in the same manner that CONNECT instances do. services that are **inter-connectible** can be connected 
to via CONNECT-platform's services feature, which allows them to automatically add wrapper nodes for each public end-point
of the service, making using this services within the platform extremely convenient. additionally we also believe 
(firmly, no kidding) that this is a nice format for communicating micro-service APIs (in a little bit higher level
and hence more human readable format than alternatives at least).
