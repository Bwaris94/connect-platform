# Change Log

This is a log of all major changes to [CONNECT platform](https://loreanvictor.github.io/connect-platform/).

The format is inspired by [Keep a Changelog](http://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/)
and we use [Semantic Versioning](http://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html), like strictly.

## [Unreleased]
### Added
 - timeouts for **Test** and **Watch** features.
 - a new node type for de-structuring.
 - code documentation.

## [0.1.3] - 2018-06-20
### Added
 - Change Log, obviously.
 - **Watch** feature:
   - you can now **Watch** your nodes in response to real invocations, which is when they are called by other nodes or, if they are public, they are invoked by a request directly.
   - basically, when you start **Watch**-ing your node, the first invocation of that path will be recorded with the given inputs of the invocation.
   - I expect this becomes specially handy in testing client-server connections and web-hooks.
 - you can debug errors using the **Test** feature:
   - errors are now recorded events like other flow events.
   - when an error occurs during execution of a sub-node of the node being tested, the recording will end, the node causing the error will be highlighted in red and also the cause will be displayed. clicking on the node will also a full stack trace.

## [0.1.2] - ~2018-05-20
### Added
 - **Test** feature:
   - you can run a node via the panel, and see a detailed recording of its execution visually on the logical flow graph.
   - you will be asked to give proper input values if the node requires some inputs.
   - there is a nice client-side player for watching these recordings, which is like a video player but also highlights events on the timeline which should be useful in performance analysis.
   - you can see exact timing of all events, the node activation periods, data that is being passed on the connections of the nodes, etc, etc.
   - what I am trying to say is, it is really beautiful.

## [0.1.1] - ~2018-04-20
### Added
 - readme and [guides on medium](https://medium.com/connect-platform/guides/home)
 - a nice utility node named `#iterate` for iterating over arrays, now that looping is allowed.
### Changes
 - looping is now allowed.

## [0.1.0] - ~2018-04-15
### Added
 - a nice [NPM package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/connect-platform/). this of course required tweaks to the code of the panel to be nicely shippable.
